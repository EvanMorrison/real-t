## All Your Base Are Belong to Us

This is a full stack project in the MEAN stack. Which is aptly named in this case as this SPA is a partial recreation of a program I wrote many years ago in VB for Office, when as an attorney I needed something to manage foreclosures I was handling for my employer. Thankfully, the loans I was foreclosing were commercial and speculative, so I never had to kick anyone out of their home.

This web app is for case management of non-judicial foreclosures in Deed of Trust states where the procedures and timing of each step are strictly regulated and uniform from one case to the next.

The general target features of the app are to:
* Store and display all information relating to the property and parties involved in the case.
* Allow user entry of new case information.
* Generate the necessary legal documents with the case-specific data.  
* Automatically project the schedule and generate mailing and publication info for the appropriate parties and jurisdiction.

The front end is built using Angularjs with Angular Material, and routing is handled by UI-Router. Frontend package management is handled with Bower. The backend uses Node.js, npm, and MongoDB.
